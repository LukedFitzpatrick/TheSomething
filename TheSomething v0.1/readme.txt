Release Notes v0.1 
7th June 2015

-Aim of the game: get red bar all the way to the bottom. You lose the game if the red bar goes past the end

-Glyphs: Before each game you select 3 'glyphs' which give you abilities. 
	
   Bullet Time: When you get close to an enemy, time slows down
	
   Double Jump: You can jump while already in the air
	
   Dash: Double tap right or left to move extremely quickly
	
   Magnet: Press spacebar to drop a magent which will attract enemies
	
   Smokescreen:  Press spacebear, any enemies who come near to you will freeze
   
   Armour: You have a 1/3 chance of killing any enemy who touches you
   
   Infection: Any enemy who touches you becomes 'diseased', and will die in 20 seconds. Any other enemies they touch will also get the disease

   Charge: Double tap right or left to move quickly, any enemy you touch while charging will die

   Fire: Hold spacebar to leave a trail of fire

   Nuke: Press spacebar to kill all enemies on the screen

   Void: Similar to magent, but enemies die when they touch it

-Whenever you use a glyph which kills enemies, your bar goes up. You need to maintain a balance between culling enemies and getting your bar down.

-Eventually glyphs will be unlocked by beating successive levels, now you can just choose any

-Controls:  WASD: Jump/Left/Right/Accelerate Downwards while in the air
            Q/E: Change active glyph out of your three selections.
            Spacebar: Use glyphs
